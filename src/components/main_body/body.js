          In a major discovery, astronomers have for the first time detected
          stars that are blasting radio signals hinting at the presence of
          hidden planets around them. The signals were picked up using the
          world’s most powerful radio antenna, the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)
          situated in the Netherlands.The new technique of spotting hidden
          planets could hint at the possibility of life in the system, which
          remains the biggest question in astronomy. Are we alone? The signals
